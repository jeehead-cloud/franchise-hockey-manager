## 1. Current Development Phase

**F25 — Youth Generation: implemented locally (not committed).** Deterministic annual youth cohorts for configured countries: versioned country youth profiles and fictional name pools; reference-date ages 15–17 (emphasis on 17); skater/goalie generation with F5-derived CA/role; players persist as `PROSPECT` / `GENERATED_YOUTH` with no club; preview → prepare → atomic execute with immutable cohort/provenance. No scouting, draft, or club assignment.

**Next milestone: F26** (scouting estimates — do not start until requested).

F1–F24 remain complete on `main` (F24 at `b5113dd`).

## 2. Milestone Status

### F1–F24

Complete on `main`.

### F25 — Youth Generation (Done locally)

Implemented:
- Engine `packages/engine/src/youth-generation/` — profiles, names, ages, distributions, skater/goalie attributes, cohort generation, hashes, reconciliation, readiness; `verify:youth-generation`
- Prisma: profile sets/versions, active config, country name pools, runs/cohorts/`YouthGeneratedPlayer`; migration `20260715000000_f25_youth_generation`
- Server: bootstrap fictional NAV/SGL defaults; preview/prepare/execute; public + commissioner APIs
- Client: `/youth-generation`, run detail, player provenance, World card
- Physical height/weight/shoots stored on provenance only (not Player columns)
- Existing players, lineups, NT snapshots, archives, development runs unchanged by generation

Not in F25:
- F26 scouting; F27 draft; contracts/FA/trades; club assignment; junior competitions; real-world name/player data; next WorldSeason; offseason orchestration

### M1–M8

Unchanged.

---

## 3. Known Bugs / Limitations Worth Remembering

- Scoring rates remain high in detailed F14 (~10 goals/game).
- International templates and youth profiles are simplified hobby presets — **not real-world calibrated**.
- Default youth name pools are fictional development examples for fixture countries only.
- Manual UI verification for F25 was **NOT RUN**.
- F25 changes not yet committed/pushed.
- Commissioner header is not security.
- Retired players may still appear on team roster lists until offseason cleanup (F30).

---

## 4. Nearest Next Steps

1. Commit/push F25 when the owner requests.
2. Manual UI pass on disposable DB (profiles → preview → prepare → execute → prospects/provenance).
3. **F26** when requested.

## 6. Significant Changes

### 2026-07-13 — F25 Youth Generation (Significant)

- Youth generation uses an explicit `referenceDate` (never wall clock); ages exactly 15–17
- One completed official youth-generation run per WorldSeason; preview never writes; publication is atomic
- Generated players are `PROSPECT` + `GENERATED_YOUTH` with `currentTeamId = null`
- Current ability and role are derived via F5 after attribute generation; potential is generated separately and not auto-grown
- Country youth profiles and fictional name pools are versioned and immutable per run
- Completed generation provenance (`YouthGeneratedPlayer`) is immutable even if F6 later edits the live Player
- F25 creates no scouting estimates, draft eligibility, club assignment, or next WorldSeason

### 2026-07-13 — F24 Player Development (Significant)

- Official development uses an explicit `effectiveDate` (never wall clock) for age
- One completed official development run per WorldSeason; preview never writes; publication is atomic
- Potential does not automatically increase; CA and role are recalculated via existing F5 functions after attribute changes
- Retirement marks `RETIRED` without deleting the player or clearing `currentTeamId` in F24
- Club ownership, club lineups, locked national-team snapshots, and F20 archives remain unchanged
- F24 creates no new players and does not advance WorldSeason
- Development config is separately versioned from F10 match-balance presets

### 2026-07-13 — F23 International Tournaments (Significant)

- International matches use locked F22 national-team snapshots (not club lineups)
- WJC eligibility uses stored F22 cutoff rules (no wall clock)
- Completed tournaments immutable; templates are simplified formats — not claimed IIHF/IOC replicas
